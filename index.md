## Welcome to L'Aura

_L'Aura_ is a transportable product-system, capable of transforming any room into a multi-sensory environment with a high level of immersion.

### The project

The product features a structure made of a series of panels: thanks to laser cutting, the panels are shaped both on the external perimeter and on the inside. The succession of cut panels generates compartments with strong and suitable supports to house technologies.
